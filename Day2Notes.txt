Today is HTML class.
HTML is a language but not programing.
Hypertext Markup Language

We have a front-end that consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Java and JavaScript are totally different. 

HTML is a skeleton of website
CSS is for design (colors, shadows, paddings, margin )

JavaScript for actions (behavior) - alerts, AJAX..

JS can be used for back-end too, for example NodeJS is platform that allows develop beck-end side of web application. 


IN my project we had bunch of applications. WE used HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JQuery) for front-end

For back-end we used JAVA EE only
